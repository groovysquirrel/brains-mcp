# Overview
The parser processes markdown content to extract capabilities organized into three main sections: Defining, Shared, and Enabling capabilities. Each section can contain multiple value streams, and each value stream can have multiple Level 1 and Level 2 capabilities.

# Key Components
## Imports and Types:
- The marked library is used to tokenize the markdown content.
- Several TypeScript interfaces define the structure of capabilities, such as Level1Capability, Level2Capability, ValueStream, and ParsedContent.

## Function: cleanCapabilityName:
- This helper function removes prefixes like VS1:, L1:, and L2: from capability names. It uses a regular expression to match these patterns and trims any leading or trailing whitespace.

## Function: parseMarkdown:
Initialization:
- The function starts by logging a message and tokenizing the markdown content using marked.lexer.
- It initializes a result object to store the parsed capabilities, with separate arrays for defining, shared, and enabling capabilities.
- Variables like currentSection, currentValueStream, and currentL1Capability are used to keep track of the current context as the parser processes the tokens.

## Token Processing:
- The function iterates over each token produced by the lexer. Tokens represent different parts of the markdown, such as headings and lists.

## Headings:
- The parser checks the depth of each heading to determine its level (e.g., #, ##, ###, ####).
- Depth 1 (#): Identifies the main sections (Defining, Shared, Enabling) based on the heading text.
- Depth 2 (##): Within the Defining section, identifies value streams. It uses cleanCapabilityName to extract the stream name and initializes a new ValueStream object.
- Depth 3 (###): Identifies Level 1 capabilities. It creates a Level1Capability object and adds it to the appropriate section or value stream.
- Depth 4 (####): Identifies Level 2 capabilities. It adds these to the most recently processed Level 1 capability.

## Lists:
- When a list token is encountered, the parser assumes it contains descriptions for the most recent capability. It assigns the description to the appropriate Level 1 or Level 2 capability.

## Logging and Return:
After processing all tokens, the function logs the parsed result and returns the result object, which contains the structured data extracted from the markdown.

# Example Usage
- The testParser function demonstrates how to use parseMarkdown. It provides a sample markdown input, calls the parser, and logs the result. This is useful for testing and verifying that the parser correctly interprets the markdown structure.

# Conclusion
This parser is a robust tool for extracting structured data from markdown documents. It leverages the marked library for tokenization and uses TypeScript interfaces to ensure the data is well-structured. By cleaning capability names and organizing them into a hierarchical structure, the parser makes it easy to work with complex markdown documents in a programmatic way.
