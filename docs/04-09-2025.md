# LLM Gateway Refactoring Summary

## Overview
We refactored the LLM Gateway implementation to improve serverless support and create a more modular, maintainable architecture. The monolithic `Gateway.ts` was separated into several specialized components that follow the singleton pattern used by AWS clients.

## Key Changes

### Architectural Improvements
1. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into distinct, specialized components
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented module-level singletons for AWS resources to optimize Lambda cold starts
3. **Improved Caching**: Added efficient caching for model configurations
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Applied uniform patterns across the system

### New Components
1. **GatewayManager.ts**
   - Global variables for Lambda environment reuse
   - Initialization functions
   - Central entry point for the gateway

2. **ConversationManager.ts**
   - Handles conversation state and history
   - Separates conversation logic from gateway processing

3. **MetricsManager.ts**
   - Manages metrics collection and reporting
   - Implements token and cost tracking

4. **RequestProcessor.ts**
   - Handles request validation
   - Normalizes inputs for different LLM providers

5. **BedrockClient.ts**
   - Provides consistent access to AWS Bedrock service
   - Follows the pattern used by other AWS clients (S3Client, SQSClient)

### Cost Tracking Implementation
1. **Model Cost Definition**
   - Added `CostPerToken` interface to `Model.ts`
   - Different rates for input and output tokens

2. **Metrics Enhancement**
   - Updated `Metrics.ts` with cost information
   - Implemented detailed cost calculation in `MetricsManager.ts`

3. **Pricing Configuration**
   - Updated `models.json` with realistic pricing for different models:
     - Claude models
     - Llama models
     - Various other supported LLMs

### Cleanup
1. Removed redundant `index.ts` file
2. Streamlined entry points through `gatewayHandler.ts` and `chat.ts`
3. Eliminated duplicate code paths

## Recent Enhancements (04-09-2025)

### Metrics System Improvements
1. **Fixed Token Counting**
   - Enhanced token extraction from response metadata
   - Added robust fallbacks for different metadata formats
   - Improved token counting in streaming responses
   - Fixed user ID propagation throughout the metrics pipeline

2. **Configurable Logging**
   - Implemented centralized log level configuration via `logger.json`
   - Added dynamic log level control to reduce console noise
   - Created static configuration methods for runtime log level adjustment

3. **Aurora Database Integration**
   - Created comprehensive metrics storage solution using Aurora PostgreSQL
   - Implemented automatic table creation with optimized schema
   - Added robust error handling and connection management
   - Designed schema for efficient analytics queries:
     - User-based metrics analysis
     - Model performance tracking
     - Cost allocation and reporting
     - Token usage patterns

4. **WebSocket Optimizations**
   - Added configurable verbosity controls for connection management
   - Reduced console noise during high-throughput operations
   - Fixed message alternation issues for streamed responses

### Benefits
1. **Complete Metrics Pipeline**: End-to-end tracking from request to database storage
2. **Improved Diagnostics**: Configurable logging based on operational needs
3. **Analytics Ready**: Structured data stored in Aurora for business intelligence
4. **Cost Transparency**: Detailed token usage and cost data for billing
5. **Production Readiness**: More stable and reliable messaging architecture

## Benefits
1. **Improved Serverless Performance**: Optimized for Lambda environments by reusing clients
2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns
3. **Better Cost Visibility**: Accurate tracking of token usage and associated costs
4. **Scalability**: More modular architecture allows for easier future extensions
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized approach across the codebase
