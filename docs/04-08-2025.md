# LLM Gateway Development - April 8, 2025

## Today's Accomplishments

### API Handler Implementation
- Created and refined API handler for LLM Gateway
- Implemented secure user identity extraction from tokens
- Added validation to prevent empty userIds causing database errors
- Enhanced security by preventing user impersonation attempts

### Metrics Collection System
- Implemented a comprehensive metrics tracking system
- Created optimized S3 and SQS clients with module-level singleton pattern
- Added support for tracking important data points (user ID, tokens, model, etc.)
- Made metrics collection non-blocking to maintain API performance
- Created pattern for differentiated storage of conversation vs. standalone prompts

### DynamoDB Conversation Repository
- Enhanced DynamoDB implementation with proper filtering
- Added explicit `itemType` attribute to differentiate metadata from messages
- Fixed filtering issues in the `listConversations` method
- Improved error handling in repository methods

### Infrastructure & Code Quality
- Refactored folder structure for improved maintainability
- Optimized code for serverless environments
- Consolidated type definitions to appropriate locations
- Improved configuration management with repository pattern

## Tomorrow's Plan

1. Optimize the Gateway implementation for better serverless support
2. Implement a handler for processing metrics from SQS to RDS
3. Implement secure storage for API keys and sensitive information
4. Add Nova as a new vendor to validate implementation patterns
5. Add additional providers (Azure, OpenAI) to test architecture
6. Begin front-end development

## Key Insights & Decisions

1. Using explicit attributes in DynamoDB over parsing string IDs
2. Storing metrics in S3 with different paths for conversations vs. prompts
3. Implementing singleton pattern for AWS clients to optimize Lambda execution
4. Extracting user identity exclusively from authentication tokens for security
5. Using non-blocking design for metrics collection to maintain performance
