# LLM Gateway Progress Report - April 3, 2025

## Progress Summary

### 1. Streaming Implementation Success
- Successfully implemented streaming functionality in the LLM Gateway
- Added robust stream handling with proper chunk management
- Implemented connection state management for WebSocket connections
- Added comprehensive error handling for stream interruptions

### 2. Code Organization Improvements
- Refactored the codebase for better maintainability
- Separated concerns into distinct components:
  - `ConnectionManager`: Handles WebSocket connections
  - `StreamHandler`: Manages streaming responses
  - `ModelValidator`: Validates model capabilities
- Improved error handling and logging throughout

### 3. Configuration Management
- Created a more structured configuration system
- Implemented provider-specific configurations
- Added validation for model capabilities
- Separated Bedrock-specific configurations into dedicated files

### 4. Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation for all major components
- Improved code readability with clear comments
- Added type definitions for better type safety
- Documented error handling strategies

## Next Steps

### 1. API Handler Implementation
- [ ] Create a REST API handler for non-WebSocket requests
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and request validation
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization
- [ ] Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

### 2. Configuration Pattern Improvements
- [ ] Implement a more flexible configuration system
- [ ] Add environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Create a configuration validation system
- [ ] Add support for dynamic configuration updates

### 3. Additional Vendor Support
- [ ] Add support for AWS Nova
- [ ] Implement other major LLM providers
- [ ] Create vendor-specific adapters
- [ ] Add vendor-specific model validation

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add unit tests for all components
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add performance testing
- [ ] Create monitoring and alerting

### 5. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Create API usage examples
- [ ] Add deployment documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Document best practices

## Technical Debt
- Review and optimize error handling patterns
- Improve logging and monitoring
- Add more comprehensive input validation
- Enhance type safety throughout the codebase

## Notes
- Streaming implementation is working well with proper chunk management
- Need to ensure proper cleanup of resources in error cases
- Consider adding metrics collection for monitoring
- Review security best practices for API implementation
