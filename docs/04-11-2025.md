### 04-11-2025 KICKOFF INSTRUCTIONS

We are building a broad range AI node system (BRAINS) and an operating system to manage it. The project is described here: 
@README.md 

We are working on a new frontend, with the source code parked in @src and our OLD code and implementation is here @srcv1 

We recently got the websocket connectivity working. The xterm session connects to our backend websocket via these handlers @websocket 

Now that we have a connectivity working (don't break that part of the code!) it's time to rework the terminal implementation. 

We will generally want to handle commands in the default handler, in @default.ts . Therefore, the front end console doesn't need to be complex... The terminal implementation might benefit from some traditional things, like hitting the up arrow the replay command history. The console should also support the ability to change modes - I might want to see raw JSON payloads, or extract "content" from any incoming payloads and only see the content. 

What would be the easiest, cleanest way to implement a terminal with these features? It should be easy to read and follow.

### Implementation Progress

We have successfully implemented a clean and modern terminal interface with the following improvements:

#### 1. Component Structure
- Renamed Console.tsx/css to Terminal.tsx/css for better semantic clarity
- Implemented proper component hierarchy with terminal-wrapper container
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Created detailed README explaining the architecture

#### 2. UI Features
- Header bar implementation (#e3f2fd) showing system information
- Monospace boxed displays for:
  - Agent status (default)
  - Mode selection (raw/content/source)
  - Server connection status
- WebSocket response formatting with light blue highlighting
- Terminal size display (dimensions shown in header)
- Command history navigation using arrow keys

#### 3. Mode Switching
- Implemented three display modes:
  - Raw: Shows complete JSON payloads
  - Content: Displays extracted content only
  - Source: Shows message sources
- Visual feedback for mode changes
- Persistent mode selection

#### 4. Layout and Styling
- Fixed terminal sizing and scrolling
- Implemented proper padding (16px wrapper, 8px internal)
- Optimized line spacing for readability
- Removed unnecessary borders
- Fixed viewport/screen size alignment
- Proper container hierarchy for spacing
- Flex layout implementation for consistent sizing

#### 5. Connection Features
- WebSocket connection status indicator
- Clean connection state management
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Clear visual feedback for connection states

The implementation now provides a robust, user-friendly terminal interface that maintains simplicity while offering advanced features. All core requirements have been met while ensuring code maintainability and readability.

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing command autocompletion
- Add terminal session persistence
- Implement terminal split views
- Add theme customization options

## WebSocket Message Handling Improvements

### Message Format Standardization
- Created `commandType.ts` to define standardized message formats:
  - `TerminalMessage`: Messages sent from frontend to backend
  - `TerminalResponse`: Successful responses from backend
  - `TerminalError`: Error responses from backend
  - Added type guards for message validation

### Backend Changes
- Updated `default.ts` handler to:
  - Process both JSON and non-JSON messages
  - Extract `rawData` from terminal messages
  - Convert chat responses to terminal format
  - Track conversations per connection with unique IDs
  - Use conversation IDs for maintaining context

### Frontend Changes
- Updated `FrontendExecutor.ts` to:
  - Send properly formatted messages with `rawData`
  - Handle different response types (terminal, error)
  - Properly pass source information
  - Add carriage returns for better formatting

- Updated `TerminalManager.tsx` to:
  - Support different display modes:
    - `raw`: Shows complete JSON responses
    - `source`: Shows `[source]` prefixed messages
    - `content`: Shows clean message content
  - Add proper formatting for error messages
  - Improve message display with carriage returns

### Key Improvements
1. Standardized message format between frontend and backend
2. Better error handling and display
3. Conversation tracking for context
4. Flexible display modes in terminal
5. Improved message formatting and readability

### Testing Notes
- Verified message flow using websocat
- Tested different display modes
- Confirmed conversation context persistence
- Validated error message handling
