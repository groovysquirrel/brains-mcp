# WebSocket Authentication and User Context - March 31, 2025

## Overview
Today we worked on improving the WebSocket authentication and user context handling in the LLM Gateway service. The main focus was on properly authenticating users and making their information available throughout the WebSocket connection lifecycle.

## Key Changes

### 1. Authorizer Improvements
- Refactored the authorizer to use ID tokens instead of Access tokens
- Removed unnecessary Cognito API calls by using token payload directly
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added user email to the authorizer context

### 2. WebSocket Routes
- Added authorizer to all WebSocket routes:
  - `$connect`
  - `$disconnect`
  - `$default`
  - `chat`
- Ensures consistent authentication across all routes

### 3. User Context
- Made user information available throughout the WebSocket connection:
  - User ID
  - Email
  - Connection ID
- Added metadata to all responses and logs

## Technical Details

### Authorizer Response Structure
```typescript
interface AuthResponse {
  principalId: string;
  policyDocument?: PolicyDocument;
  context: {
    userId: string;
    email: string;
  };
}
```

### Connect Handler Response
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  metadata: {
    connectionId: string;
    userId: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }
}
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Token Types**: ID tokens and Access tokens serve different purposes:
   - ID tokens: Used for authentication and contain user information
   - Access tokens: Used for authorizing API calls to AWS services

2. **AWS Best Practices**:
   - Use IAM roles for service-to-service authentication
   - Avoid passing credentials in environment variables
   - Let AWS SDK handle region configuration

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces help catch errors early
   - Type assertions should be used carefully when dealing with external data

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more user context to the chat handler
2. Implement connection tracking in DynamoDB
3. Add error handling for stale connections
4. Consider adding rate limiting per user
