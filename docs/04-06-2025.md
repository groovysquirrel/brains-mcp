# LLM Gateway Design Updates - April 6, 2025

## Configuration Structure Improvements

### 1. Simplified Model Configuration
- Consolidated all model configurations into a single `models.json` file per provider
- Removed individual model JSON files to reduce duplication and maintenance overhead
- Organized models by vendor in a clear hierarchical structure:
```json
{
  "vendors": [
    {
      "name": "anthropic",
      "models": [
        {
          "modelId": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Provider Configuration Clarity
- Renamed `provider.json` to `settings.json` to better reflect its purpose
- Maintains provider-level settings like:
  - Authentication
  - Region
  - Default parameters
  - Supported vendors
  - Capabilities

### 3. Model Status Tracking
- Added `llmgateway` status information to each model:
```json
"llmgateway": {
  "status": "READY" | "NOT READY",
  "billing": "ONDEMAND" | "provisioned",
  "provisioned": boolean
}
```
- Enables tracking of model availability and billing status
- Helps prevent usage of models that aren't ready for production

## New Gateway Features

### 1. Ready Models Discovery
- Added `getReadyModels()` method to Gateway class
- Supports filtering by:
  - Provider name (optional)
  - Vendor name (optional)
- Returns only models with status "READY"
- Useful for displaying available models to users

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved error messages when model access fails
- Provides helpful alternatives when requested model is unavailable
- Hierarchical suggestion system:
  1. First suggests alternatives from same vendor
  2. Falls back to other vendors on same provider if needed
  3. Shows all available models if model not found
- Includes display names and model IDs in suggestions

## Key Learnings

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Single source of truth for model configurations
   - Reduced duplication improves maintainability
   - Clear separation between provider settings and model details

2. **Status Tracking**
   - Explicit status tracking helps prevent runtime errors
   - Clear distinction between ready and not-ready models
   - Billing information readily available

3. **User Experience**
   - Helpful error messages guide users to working alternatives
   - Clear model status indicators
   - Easy discovery of available models

4. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns in Gateway class
   - Modular configuration structure
   - Efficient model lookup and filtering

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more model metadata to suggestions:
   - Model capabilities
   - Pricing information
   - Context window sizes
   - Modality information

2. Potential future improvements:
   - Caching of ready models for performance
   - Real-time status updates
   - Model status monitoring
   - Usage analytics integration
