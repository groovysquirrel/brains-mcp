# WebSocket Authorization and Money Management Updates

## Overview
We resolved critical WebSocket connectivity issues and implemented preliminary money management features. The main focus was on fixing WebSocket authorization to work with browser limitations and setting up infrastructure for financial tracking.

## Key Changes

### WebSocket Authorization Improvements
1. **Query Parameter Authentication**
   - Moved token from authorization header to query parameters
   - Updated WebSocket authorizer configuration in infrastructure
   - Fixed browser limitation preventing header modification
   - Implemented proper JWT token handling via URL parameters

2. **Infrastructure Updates**
   - Modified Lambda authorizer configuration
   - Added `identitySources` to use `route.request.querystring.token`
   - Enhanced connection management for browser compatibility
   - Streamlined authentication flow for WebSocket connections

### Money Management Implementation
1. **Preliminary Module Setup**
   - Created foundation for financial tracking
   - Implemented basic cost management features
   - Set up infrastructure for transaction monitoring

2. **Frontend Improvements**
   - Fixed navigation links throughout the application
   - Implemented frontend restart mechanism
   - Enhanced user interface for financial features
   - Improved error handling and status displays

### WebSocket Client Enhancements
1. **Connection Management**
   - Added robust connection status tracking
   - Implemented automatic reconnection logic
   - Enhanced error message display
   - Added server selection capabilities

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Added visual feedback for connection states
   - Implemented dynamic welcome messages
   - Enhanced console interface with better styling
   - Added proper padding and visual separation

## Benefits
1. **Improved Browser Compatibility**: Resolved WebSocket connection issues across all major browsers
2. **Enhanced Security**: Maintained secure token-based authentication while working within browser constraints
3. **Better User Experience**: More reliable connection handling and clearer status feedback
4. **Financial Control**: Foundation for comprehensive money management features
5. **Robust Architecture**: More resilient WebSocket implementation with proper error handling

## Comparison with Previous Day
While April 9th focused on metrics system improvements and Aurora integration, today's changes addressed critical infrastructure and user-facing features:

### Continuing Themes
- **Improved Diagnostics**: Enhanced error handling and status reporting
- **Production Readiness**: Resolved critical browser compatibility issues
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Better separation of concerns in WebSocket handling

### New Directions
- **Financial Features**: Started money management implementation
- **Authentication Solutions**: Innovative approach to WebSocket authorization
- **UI/UX Focus**: Significant improvements to user interface and feedback

## Next Steps
1. Expand money management capabilities
2. Further enhance WebSocket reliability
3. Implement additional security measures
4. Continue improving user interface
5. Integrate with existing metrics system
