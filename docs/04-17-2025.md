# Development Summary - April 17, 2025

## Overview

Today we implemented and enhanced the MCP (Meta-Cognitive Protocol) server infrastructure by creating two essential handlers:
1. SQS Handler for processing MCP tool requests
2. WebSocket Handler for receiving MCP responses

These handlers allow the Brain Controller API to use generic tool endpoints without requiring specific handlers for each tool type.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. MCP SQS Request Handler

Created a generic SQS handler (`mcpRequestHandler.ts`) that:
- Receives tool requests from the message queue
- Initializes the MCPServer singleton
- Processes any type of MCP request (tools, transformers, etc.)
- Forwards responses to WebSocket connections
- Handles error cases gracefully
- Removes coupling to specific tool implementations

Key design principles:
- Generic handling of any MCP request type
- No tool-specific logic, delegating all processing to the MCPServer
- Loose coupling with minimal dependencies on MCPServer internals
- Type-specific response formatting with core common fields

### 2. WebSocket MCP Response Handler

Created a WebSocket handler (`mcpResponseReceiver.ts`) that:
- Receives and logs MCP responses
- Provides detailed logging for debugging tool executions
- Formats response data for easy monitoring

### 3. Test Script for Generic Tool Usage

Enhanced the tool testing capabilities by:
- Creating an interactive test script (`tool-api.test.sh`)
- Implementing automatic Cognito authentication
- Adding pause/continue/retry functionality 
- Supporting calculator and random number generation tool tests

## Technical Details

### Request Flow

1. API Gateway receives a tool request at `/default/use/tool`
2. Brain Controller API handler validates and processes the request
3. Request is sent to SQS queue
4. SQS handler processes the message and calls MCPServer
5. Response is sent through WebSocket
6. WebSocket handler logs the response

### Authentication & Security

- Using Cognito for authentication
- ID tokens for API authorization
- Connection IDs for WebSocket message routing

### MCP Integration

The implementation supports any MCP request type:
- Tools (like calculator, randomNumber)
- Transformers
- Prompts (placeholder for future implementation)
- Resources

## Future Improvements

- Add database tracking for request status
- Implement response timeouts and retries
- Add metrics collection for tool usage
- Support for additional MCPServer features as they're implemented

## Conclusion

The generic tool handler implementation provides a flexible foundation for executing any current or future MCP tool without requiring changes to the API or SQS handlers. This architecture decouples the Brain Controller API from specific tool implementations, allowing for easier integration of new capabilities.
